## What I have learnt By working on this project

1. I research about linear gradient to give a better look to the buttons and backgrounds.
2. I learn to use absolute position to add more realistic look in package section of the website.
3. code reusability by making the button class and use it multiple times.

## Honest Time to finish the project

It takes about 6 hours approximately to fully complete this project as i was new to HTML and CSS and I had to learn some new things like sibling selectors without class and different positioning.
